TastyBites is a web application developed for TastyBites restaurant customers, allowing them to easily schedule table reservations before dining. 
The platform offers a seamless and efficient reservation experience for both customers and restaurant staff. The application consists of two parts,
one for the administration and one for the customers. The application is built using a combination of modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, 
Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax, ensuring a responsive and interactive front-end. On the back-end, PHP is used to handle server-side logic, 
while MySQL database serves as the database to securely store reservation data. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, 
ensuring a clean, scalable, and maintainable code structure for future updates and enhancements. The project was a part of a university course.
